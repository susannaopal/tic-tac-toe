## Abstract
	- Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy.
  - This app will allow for two different players to play a game.
  - Player 1 (Team Buffalo) and Player 2 (Team Mountain) compete against one another to see who can place their tokes on three blocks in a row first.
  - Players can add tokens to block horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - The first player to place three tokens in a row will be the winner, else the game will end in a tied draw.
  - Player is also attempting to keep their opponent from being able to place three blocks in a row to divert from a win for them.
