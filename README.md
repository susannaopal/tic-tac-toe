## Abstract
- Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy.
- This app will allow for two different players to play a game.
- Player 1 (Team Buffalo) and Player 2 (Team Mountain) compete against one another to see who can place their tokens on three blocks in a row first.
- Players can add tokens to block horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
- The first player to place three tokens in a row will be the winner, else the game will end in a tied draw.
- Player is also attempting to keep their opponent from being able to place three blocks in a row to divert from a win for them.
- A timeout will occur after a game is won or falls to a draw that automatically updates for another game.
- Wins are stored for each player and are showcased by team on the side, they will remain despite page reload, with a message to tell if there is a winner or a draw. Additionally, the app will tell which player plays next.
