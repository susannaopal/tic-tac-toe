// A Game should include:
// Two Player instances
// A way to keep track of the data for the game board
// A way to keep track of whose turn it currently is
// A way to check the Game’s board data for win conditions
// A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)
// A way to reset the Game’s board to begin a new game*

class Game {
  constructor (player1, player2) {

  }
};

module.exports = Game;

//this needs to interact LIKE Medusa (eventually the player instances will need to pass thru the constructor)
//need two players pass through

//ex: var namePlayer = class Player ({id: id, token: token, wins: [#]})

//1 new instance of the game is 2 new instances of the player


A TIMEOUT is used after a completed game to reset the board:
does this get done here or in main?


//should conditionals be in here?
// What are said conditionals?
